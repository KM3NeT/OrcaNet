OrcaNet Contrib
===============

Scripts for the specific case of analysing orca data with OrcaNet.
Might also have some use outside of the orca experiment.

This directory is not covered and not officially supported.

Note about the ORCA4 neutrino studies scripts:
I trained the regression networks on different datasets: Muon CC up to 50GeV + shower neutrinos for the energy reco and all kinds of events for the direction reconstruction.
