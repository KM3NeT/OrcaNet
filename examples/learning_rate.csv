# Example for setting the learning rate with a csv file.
#
# Place this in the main folder of an orcanet training, then use
# learning_rate="learning_rate.csv"
# in the configuration to use it.
#
# The file must have three columns, containing the epoch, the file number,
# as well as the learning rate that will be used for the given epoch/file number pair.
# Indices start from 1, i.e. in the following example,
# the lr for the first epoch (= file 1 in epoch 1)
# is set to 0.002 in the first row (the one starting with   1   1).
# It will still be 0.002 for epoch 1 file 2, and will be changed to 0.001
# in epoch 1 file 3.
#
# Epoch Fileno  LR
1   1   0.002
1   3   0.001
2   1   0.0005
2   3   0.0001
